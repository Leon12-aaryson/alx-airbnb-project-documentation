## Data Flow Patterns

### 1. User Registration Flow
1. Guest submits registration data
2. System validates and stores in User Database
3. Email Service sends verification email
4. User confirms email
5. System activates account

### 2. Property Search Flow
1. Guest submits search criteria
2. System queries Property Database
3. Results filtered and ranked
4. Search results returned to guest
5. Guest selections cached for performance

### 3. Booking Creation Flow
1. Guest selects property and dates
2. System validates availability
3. Booking request sent to host
4. Host responds with accept/decline
5. If accepted, payment is processed
6. Booking confirmation sent to both parties

### 4. Payment Flow
1. Guest provides payment information
2. System validates payment details
3. Payment Gateway processes transaction
4. System stores transaction record
5. Payment confirmation sent to guest
6. Payout scheduled for host

### 5. Communication Flow
1. User sends message
2. System stores in Message Database
3. Notification sent to recipient
4. Email/SMS service delivers notification
5. Recipient receives message

## Data Security and Privacy

### Encryption
- All payment data encrypted at rest and in transit
- Personal information encrypted in database
- SSL/TLS for all external communications

### Access Control
- Role-based access to different data stores
- API authentication for all data access
- Audit logging for sensitive operations

### Data Retention
- User data retained per privacy policy
- Payment data retained per PCI compliance
- Booking data retained for business purposes
- Communication data retained for support

## Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategy
- User sessions cached for quick access
- Popular searches cached for performance
- Property data cached for search results
- Static content cached at CDN level

### Database Optimization
- Indexes on frequently queried fields
- Database partitioning for large tables
- Read replicas for query performance
- Connection pooling for efficiency

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling for high-traffic processes
- Load balancing across multiple servers
- Microservices architecture for independent scaling
- Queue systems for async processing

## Error Handling

### Data Validation
- Input validation at all entry points
- Schema validation for database operations
- Business rule validation for bookings
- Error logging for debugging

### Failure Recovery
- Transaction rollback for failed operations
- Retry logic for external service calls
- Fallback mechanisms for service outages
- Data backup and recovery procedures

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Data Flow Monitoring
